# jQuery Equal Heights

A script to "equalize" the heights of boxes within the same container and create
a tidy grid

## Fork

*	Adapted by Greg Turner to work on elements, not their children, and to take
	into account borders and padding.
*	Added to by Mark Finger to include `equalHeightsByHClass` which groups
	elements together by a `h-class` attribute, then equalises the heights of
	each group of elements.
