# jQuery Equal Heights

A script to "equalize" the heights of boxes within the same container and create
a tidy grid

## Fork

*	Adapted by Greg Turner to work on elements, not their children, and to take
	into account borders and padding
*	Added to by Mark Finger to include `equalHeightsByHClass` which can group
	elements before applying `equalHeights`

This fork of the jQuery plugin is something we've used for a few projects at
[the Interaction Consortium](http://interaction.net.au). It's been used for
projects such as [the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia](http://mca.com.au)
and [the National Association of Visual Artists' ARIna project]
(http://arina.org.au).
